# Application Modernization using Appsody 


Only 30% of enterprises migrated to Cloud other 70% want's to but due to insufficient technical knowledge in app modernization they can’t migrate their on prem data to Cloud. As for that they need to apply various technology stacks before moving to Cloud some of them are Docker, Containerization, Kubernetes , CI/CD and many others.

What if we could have single integrated platform , that contains all these platforms  ? 

“Appsody” is designed to help you develop containerized applications for the cloud.
Now enterprises just need to focus on their business and let Appsody build applications for the cloud that are ready to be deployed to Kubernetes without being an expert on the underlying container technology. 

There are 3 main key components:

## Appsody Stacks:
Already built stack and frameworks that only need to be configured into your project such as Java with Eclipse MicroProfile and Node.js with Express

## Appsody Hub:
The Hub is the central point of control for Appsody Stacks where you can find available stacks. create new stacks, or modify existing ones. 

## Appsody CLI:
Appsody CLI allows developers use already build stacks and  bring them into their local development environment. From here, they can build, run, test, and deploy applications locally. Once they are done with their local development can containerize it and deploy on the cloud.
